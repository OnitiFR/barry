## TODO
- update github.com/briandowns/spinner once fixed https://github.com/briandowns/spinner/issues/123
- expiration of retrieved files
- commands
    - project delete (with all content?)
    - file info
- show worker upload % in status
- no backup alert: display last backup date
- per-project no-backup alert threshold
- check re-up of an existing file in the DB
- HTTPS support for API server
- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- allow Swift config from env
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure
