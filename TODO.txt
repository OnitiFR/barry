## TODO
- update github.com/briandowns/spinner once fixed https://github.com/briandowns/spinner/issues/123
- commands
    - project delete (with all content?)
    - file info
- show worker upload % in status
- check re-up of an existing file in the DB
- HTTPS support for API server
- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- allow Swift config from env
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure

WIP: encryption
- when does the decryption happen? MakeFileAvailable() ?
- display encrypted flag in client
- provide a manual decryption tool?
