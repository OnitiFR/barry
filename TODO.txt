### needed for a V1
- API server
    - get file
    - list projects
    - list files

### later
- per-project no-backup alert threshold
- check re-up of an existing file in the DB
- add worker status maps ? (idle, uploading) for status command ?
- filter project without any files? (and add --all option)
- HTTPS support for API server
- error count on files? (maybe to noisy to report each file)
- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- remove empty project? (so new default settings can be used)
- allow Swift config from env
- direct upload to mulch server?
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure
