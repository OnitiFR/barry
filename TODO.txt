## TODO
- update github.com/briandowns/spinner once fixed https://github.com/briandowns/spinner/issues/123
- commands
    - project delete (with all content?)
    - file info
- show worker upload % in status
- check re-up of an existing file in the DB
- HTTPS support for API server
- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- allow Swift config from env
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure

WIP: encryption
- /!\ add a way to check key validity!
- check all decryption paths! (local download, retrieved, pushed, etc)
- test perfomance! (for big files)
- test edge cases (ex: key was removed from config since updload)
- we currently decrypt files once for all when they're made available, but what about
  localy decrypted files when they expire? (remote is still encrypted)
  (should we crypt them again after a short time?)
