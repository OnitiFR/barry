## TODO
- update github.com/briandowns/spinner once fixed https://github.com/briandowns/spinner/issues/123
- commands
    - project delete (with all content?)
    - file info
- show worker upload % in status
- check re-up of an existing file in the DB
- HTTPS support for API server
- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- allow Swift config from env
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure

WIP: encryption
- check all decryption paths! (todo: retrieved, pushed)
- allow a "per projet" activation? (so we can deploy gradually to test performance hit)
  - everything is done in the background, so backup process itself is not impacted?
- test performance! (for big files)
  - encryption, dev workstation: 8.4 GB in 2m11s (~65 MB/s)
  - seems IO bound
- test edge cases (ex: key was removed from config since **updload**)
- re-encryption on with mutex lock is bad :(
