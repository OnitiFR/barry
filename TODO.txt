### needed for a V1
- shorter settings for dev mode
- alert "no backup since"
- API server
    - list projects
    - list files
    - get file

### later

- create project from cli (so expiration params are ready BEFORE first upload)
- remove empty project? (so new default settings can be used)
- allow Swift config from env
- direct upload to mulch server?
- use original Expiration values when uploading after a failure
